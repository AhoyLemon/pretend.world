### You are at a party of celebrity impersonators.

## Hm?
This is a game that invites the player to guess the photo of each celebrity impersonator presented to him.

## Who made this?
[Lemon](https://github.com/AhoyLemon) created the game, with some help.

## But who did those drawings?
The illustrations used in this game were made by [Sanguinary Novel](https://twitter.com/aberrantwhimsy), who is excellent. If you want to commision her to do a drawing for you, that would probably be a very good idea.
