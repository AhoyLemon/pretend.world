    "The guest before you is so delighted with your sharp wit and flattery they manage to stop talking about how they could have easily replaced the actor from the movie, had they only been there.",
    "The impersonator leans forward and glances around. They press a business card into your hand and whisper about an agent with the all of the best gigs good buddy.",
    "The impersonators around you "

  prettyGood: [
    "You give finger guns to three separate people whom you have never met. Only one of those finger gun’d makes a face like you just farted. You consider this a success."

  neutral: [
    "Wait staff weave through oversized props and bulky skirts while carrying cocktails painfully based off pun potential and not taste. The guests, however, are absolutely delighted.",
    "You wonder if there had been a squabble over the party theme, every impersonator vying to have THEIR movie recreated in the space. The result was a mixture of an 80s high school prom, derelict building props on the walls, medieval glassware, and just too much glitter."

  prettyBad: [
    "The opening riff of Dee-Lite’s “Groove Is In The Heart” starts to play, and you make an utterly nonsensical joke about Josh Grobin In The Heart? Like, Josh Grobin is in your heart? Something like that. It is a <i>terrible</i> joke and everybody heard it.",
    "Nervous, you try to shift the conversation to the latest gossip, something about the Renaissance hotel using a blue cheese and mozzarella mix. But this only raises more suspicion about your intent.",

  ],
  veryBad: [
    "A joke about Harvey Weinstein goes <i>way</i> off the rails and comes off as overtly anti-semitic. A Scarlett Johansson impersonator asks who let you in here, and you feel sweat on your forehead.",
    "You make an offhand comment about an Edward Scissorhands' props, asking him if he wrapped plastic safety scissors from the Dollar Store in tinfoil. He bursts into tears and runs out of the room, bits of foil falling on the ground in his wake. Everyone at the party thinks you are SUCH an asshole for mentioning this.",
    "Unable to keep up with the flood of pointless references, you accidentally let drop that you don't <i>actually like movies.</i> The whole party goes silent, a glass falls to the floor and shatters. The quiet is only broken when someone yells Rosebud!. The crowd laughs, but does not forget."

  noChange: [
    "In a poorly lit corner, you see an Ashton Kutcher impersonator making out with a Demi Moore impersonator. A few feet away, a Bruce Willis impersonator is seemingly unphased by all of this, which seems oddly progressive.",
