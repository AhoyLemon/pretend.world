  //"These parties always have impressive spreads that spared no expense; figs from the middle east, the fresh caviar from Russia, and freshly baked pastries from France. All garbage for peasants. This cheese log is the true treasure."
  "On the other side of the room you notice a few snacks: Some croissants, potato chips, deviled eggs: This is all garbage for peasants. But among this trash you notice a cheese log, and this is your mission. You <i>must</i> get to this cheese log",
  "One of the reasons you so enjoy crashing parties like this is because there's often decent snacks. This time though? This time they have a cheese log. You must have it.",
  "For a moment you consider trying to crash some other party until, on the other side of the room, you notice a cheese log, and you become suddenly obsessed. This cheese log is now your mission in life."

    "You’re so close now, the table almost within arms reach. You can see each mustard seed gracing the surface, and the glistening cheese throwing you “come hither” looks over the guests' shoulder. It won’t be long now, my dairy love.",
    "Your presence near the cheese log is now what could fairly be described as menacing. You run your tongue over your teeth.",
    "The cheese is just barely beyond your reach, its golden interiors gracefully spread open to your waiting touch. If only you could hurry through this conversation.",
    "You wipe the corner of your mouth with a furtive hand while the impersonator before you continues to prattle on about accurate props. The earthy, sharp scent of cheese fills your nostrils it's so close."

  medium: [
    "Would the courts accept love of cheese as an acceptable excuse for manslaughter? Surely no jury could hold you accountable, as the cheese is what separates us from animals, as the animals at this party are keeping you from obtaining cheese enlightenment.",
    "You reach into your pocket, thumbing the little yellow diary you keep of past cheese love affairs. Long has the pistachio fig brie peacock sculpture from last year’s Honey Soiree been your top prize, but the one before you is sure to take that spot in your heart.",
    "You relax your focus a bit, and notice some salami on the west end of the table. A water cracker, the salami, maybe a sliced green olive, and that wonderful, wonderful cheese. Soon this dream will become a reality."

  far: [
    "You find yourself in physical discomfort as you reckon how far you are from the cheese log. You must close the gap.",
    "As many a great explorer from the past, you will travel any distance, face any danger, all to get close to that golden cheese.",
    "The world drops away into a fog, the guests voices soften to dull murmurs; over it all, the gruyere on the furthest table gazes lustfully at you.",
    "Get to the cheese table? You'd sooner arrive at the moon before finally resting your questing fingers upon those soft silvers of swiss.",
    "Had Shakespeare written about cheese? Perhaps a sonnet sonnet or a poem of parmesean would bring this crowd to bear, and allow you to close the gap."

    "These parties always have impressive spreads that spared no expense; figs from the middle east, the fresh caviar from Russia, and freshly baked pastries from France. All garbage for peasants. This cheese log is the true treasure.",
    "The cheese had been delicately rolled in slivered almonds, concealing the golden spread within. You sniff the air. Did those geniuses even include a hint of scallion? You must get closer.",
    "You glance past the latest impersonator back to the cheese table and gasp, as bits of the beautiful, once whole log have been damaged by rabid impersonator wolves. But none shall keep you from sampling that luscious log.",
    "A knife slices into the cheese log, and you hiss like a vampire. You watch a guest draw the cheese and cracker into his mouth, and he doesn’t even appreciate it. Not like <i>you</i> would.",
    "Over there she lay, the most beautiful thing in the world. Nothing can compare to her beauty, her grace, her easily spreadable interior. The most expensive cheeses rolled into a log shape rested on a silver platter, soley for you.",
    "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, that's one <i>greezy log!</i>"
