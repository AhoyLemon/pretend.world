    "You’re so close now, the table almost within arms reach. You can see each mustard seed gracing the surface, and the glistening cheese throwing you “come hither” looks over the guests' shoulder. It won’t be long now, my dairy love.",
    "Your presence near the cheese log is now what could fairly be described as menacing. You run your tongue over your teeth."

  medium: [
    "Would the courts accept love of cheese as an acceptable excuse for manslaughter? Surely no jury could hold him accountable, as the cheese is what separates us from animals, as the animals at this party are keeping you from obtaining cheese enlightenment.",
    "You reach into your pocket, thumbing the little yellow diary you keep of past cheese love affairs. Long has the pistachio fig brie peacock sculpture from last year’s Honey Soiree been your top prize, but the one before you is sure to take that spot in your heart.",
    "You relaxed your focus a bit, and notice some salami on the west end of the table. A water cracker, the salami, maybe a sliced green olive, and that wonderful, wonderful cheese. Soon this dream will become a reality."

    "You find yourself in physical discomfort as you reckon how far you are from the cheese log. You must close the gap."

    "These parties always have impressive spreads that spared no expense; figs from the middle east, the fresh caviar from Russia, and freshly baked pastries from France. All garbage for peasants. This cheese log is the true treasure.",
    "The cheese had been delicately rolled in slivered almonds, concealing the golden spread within. You sniff the air. Did those geniuses even include a hint of scallion? You must get closer.",
    "You glance past the latest impersonator back to the cheese table and gasp, as bits of the beautiful, once whole log have been damaged by rabid impersonator wolves. But none shall keep you from sampling that luscious log.",
    "A knife slices into the cheese log, and you hiss like a vampire. You watch a guest draw the cheese and cracker into his mouth, and he doesn’t even appreciate it. Not like <i>you</i> would.",
